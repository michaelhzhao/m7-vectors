# Exercise 1: Creating and Indexing Vectors

# Create a vector `x` that has the values 10 through 20 in it (using the `:` operator)

x <- 10:20
# Create a vector `y` that has the values 21 through 30 in it (using the `seq` operato
# Create a variable `w` that is equal to the 11th element in your vector `z`
w <- z[11]

# Create a vector `q` that is equal to the second through the 5 elements of `z`

q <- z[2:5]

# Create a variable `len` that is equal to the length of your vector `q`

len <- length(z)

### Bonus ###

# Create a vector `odd` that holds the odd numbers from 1 to 100


# Using the `all` function, confirm that all of the numbers in your `odd` vector are odd
